Client-Server Communication

In this module you will explore client-server communication using both Angular HTTP module and the REST API. You will get a brief introduction to animation support in Angular and create a custom attribute directive. You will also learn about testing, building and deploying Angular applications.



This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 6.2.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding
